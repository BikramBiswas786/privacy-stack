# Anon Lab — Four Positioning Pillars

## 1. Credibility First
Every paper is citable and provenance is proven.
- Every entry links to DOI or arXiv
- Metadata verified by human reviewers
- Verification log is public
- Authors can endorse or correct

## 2. Pedagogy Second
Outputs teach, not just show.
- TL;DR for quick understanding
- Learning objectives up front
- Threat model explained visually
- Exercises with answers
- Real use cases

## 3. Safety Always
Cryptographic and legal safeguards are explicit.
- Threat model documented for every paper
- Security commentary in plain English
- Limitations and known attacks listed
- No hidden assumptions
- Ethical use guidelines visible

## 4. Open Collaboration
Community review over closed automation.

## Tone & Persona

Write like a lab that publishes reproducible artifacts and lab notes:
- Authoritative but humble
- Forensic (evidence-based)
- Neutral, scholarly language
- No marketing puffery
- Conditional claims, not guarantees
